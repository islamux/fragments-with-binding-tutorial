## Main Activity Steps

This section outlines the key steps involved in the `MainActivity` class.

1. **Variable Declaration:**
   - Declare variables for binding the activity's layout and the fragments you'll be using.

2. **Binding Initialization:**
   - Initialize the binding variable to connect your activity to the layout resource.

3. **Layout Setup:**
   - Set the activity's content view using the binding variable. This inflates the layout and binds the UI elements to your code.

4. **Fragment Setup:**
   - Initialize variables for the fragments you'll be managing.
   - Optionally, you can set click listeners for buttons or other UI elements within the fragments themselves (consider separating fragment-specific logic into the fragments' classes).

5. **Fragment Switching Function:**
   - Create a function to handle switching between fragments within the activity.
   - This function should typically use the `getSupportFragmentManager()` and a `FragmentTransaction` object to:
     - Add the new fragment to the activity's container view.
     - Replace or hide the current fragment (depending on your desired behavior).

6. **Button Click Listener (Optional):**
   - If you haven't set click listeners within the fragments, you can set a click listener for a button in your activity.
   - Within the click listener, call the fragment switching function to transition between fragments.
